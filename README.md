# mini_machine
This is a Repository for my mini machine project that is based of The Machine from Person of interest.
Here I will post the different versions of my machine along with the associated folders and files. 

## V1
- Reads a single profile and displays to the user the name, age, height, weight, (Fake) SSN, risk level, activity ratings, and a list of flags.
- I also learned how to make the output appear as it is being typed by making a `type_out` function.
